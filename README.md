# Hangman - Safari Edition

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This README provides an overview of the Hangman game and instructions for playing it.

## Game Description
The Hangman game involves the following components:

A word to be guessed: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list or a custom word provided by the player.
Hidden word display: The word to be guessed is initially displayed as a series of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter in the word.
Guessing attempts: The player can guess individual letters one at a time. If the letter is present in the word, it is revealed in the hidden word display. If the letter is not present, the player loses an attempt.
Incorrect guesses: The game keeps track of the incorrect letters guessed by the player and displays them.
Game completion: The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts. In the latter case, the player loses the game.
